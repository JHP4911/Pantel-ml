    "# ScikitLearn - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in python.\n",
    "- It contains powerful tools for machine learning and statistical modelling.\n",
    "- The statistical modelling includes classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction through a consistent interface in python.\n",
    "- This library is written in python and built on top of Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ScikitLearn - Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- ScikitLearn library is used for modelling on data rather than focused on loading, manipulating and summarising data.\n",
    "- Following are the popular groups of models provided by sklearn.\n",
    "    1. Supervised Learning Algorithms - Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Decision Tree are part of scikit-learn\n",
    "    2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms - It has all unsupervised learning algoritms from clustering, factor analysis and PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Clustering - This model is grouping unlabelled data.\n",
    "- Cross validation - It is used to check the accuracy of supervised models on unseen data.\n",
    "- Dimensionality Reduction - It is used to reduce the number of attributes in the data. It can be used for summarisation, visualisation and feature selection.\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods - It is used to combine the predictions of multiple supervised models.\n",
    "- Feature Extraction - It is used to extract the features from data to define the attributes in an image.\n",
    "- Feature selection - It is used to identify the useful attributes to create supervised models.\n",
    "- Open Source - It is a open source library and available under BSD license.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ScikitLearn - Modelling Process\n",
    "\n",
    "It deals with the modelling process involved in sklearn.\n",
    "1. Dataset Loading - Dataset is nothing but a collection of data.\n",
    "2. Features - Variables of data are called its features. They are known as predictor inputs or attributes.\n",
    "3. Feature matrix - A feature matrix is nothing but a collection of features.\n",
    "4. Feature names - It is a list of all the names of the features.\n",
    "\n",
